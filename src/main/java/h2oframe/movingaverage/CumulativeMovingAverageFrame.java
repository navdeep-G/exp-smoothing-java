/**Cumulative Moving Average (CMA)
 *
 * In a cumulative moving average, the data arrive in an ordered datum stream, and the user would like to get the
 * average of all of the data up until the current datum point. For example, an investor may want the average price
 * of all of the stock transactions for a particular stock up until the current time. As each new transaction occurs,
 * the average price at the time of the transaction can be calculated for all of the transactions up to that point using
 * the cumulative average, typically an equally weighted average of the sequence of n values x_1...x_n up to the
 * current time.
